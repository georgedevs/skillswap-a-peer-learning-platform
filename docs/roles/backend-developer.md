# Backend Developer Role Document for SkillSwap Project

## Role Overview
The Backend Developer plays a crucial role in the SkillSwap project by designing and implementing the server-side logic that supports the platform's functionality. This includes developing RESTful APIs for user management, implementing secure authentication and authorization mechanisms, and managing the database structure to ensure efficient data flow. The Backend Developer ensures that the application is robust, scalable, and secure, enabling seamless interactions between users and the platform.

## Key Responsibilities

### 1. Develop RESTful APIs
The Backend Developer will create APIs that allow the frontend to interact with the backend services. This includes endpoints for user registration, login, profile management, skill listings, and session scheduling.

**Example**: 
- Create an endpoint for user registration: `POST /api/users/register`
- Implement a GET endpoint to retrieve user profiles: `GET /api/users/:id`

### 2. Implement Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms
This responsibility involves setting up secure login and signup processes, using technologies such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for session management. The Backend Developer will ensure that sensitive user data is protected and that users can only access resources they are authorized to.

**Example**:
- Use bcrypt to hash passwords during registration.
- Implement middleware to protect routes that require authentication.

### 3. Manage Database Structure and Data Flow
The Backend Developer will design the MongoDB database schema to efficiently store user profiles, skills, sessions, and feedback. This includes creating models and ensuring that data is properly validated and sanitized before being stored.

**Example**:
- Create a User model with fields for username, password, skills, and learning interests.
- Define relationships between users for the matching algorithm.

## Technical Requirements
- **Node.js**: Proficiency in building server-side applications using Node.js, which will be the runtime environment for the backend.
- **Express.js**: Experience with Express.js for creating robust APIs and handling HTTP requests and responses.
- **MongoDB**: Knowledge of MongoDB for database management, including schema design and CRUD operations.
- **Authentication Protocols**: Familiarity with JWT and OAuth for implementing secure user authentication.

## Deliverables
- A set of RESTful APIs documented with Swagger or similar tools.
- User authentication system with secure login and registration processes.
- Database schema and models for MongoDB.
- Middleware for error handling and authentication checks.
- Unit tests for API endpoints and database interactions.

## Integration Points
The Backend Developer will work closely with the Frontend Developer to ensure that the APIs meet the needs of the user interface. This includes:
- Defining API contracts that specify request and response formats.
- Collaborating on data exchange formats (e.g., JSON).
- Regular communication to troubleshoot issues and refine API functionality.

## Development Workflow
- **Branching Strategy**: Use Git branching model (feature branches for new features, develop branch for integration, and main branch for production).
- **Code Review Process**: Implement peer code reviews using pull requests to ensure code quality and knowledge sharing.
- **Testing Approach**: Write unit tests for all API endpoints using a testing framework like Mocha or Jest. Conduct integration tests to ensure that the backend works seamlessly with the frontend.

## Technical Decisions
- Choose between different authentication strategies (e.g., session-based vs. token-based).
- Decide on the structure of the MongoDB database and how to handle relationships between users.
- Determine the best practices for API versioning to accommodate future changes.

## Learning Resources
- **Node.js Documentation**: https://nodejs.org/en/docs/
- **Express.js Guide**: https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html
- **MongoDB University**: https://university.mongodb.com/
- **JWT Authentication Tutorial**: https://jwt.io/introduction/
- **RESTful API Design**: https://restfulapi.net/

By following this role document, the Backend Developer will be equipped to contribute effectively to the SkillSwap project, ensuring a solid foundation for the platform's backend architecture and functionality.

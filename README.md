## üìã Project Overview

SkillSwap is a web-based platform designed to facilitate peer-to-peer learning by allowing users to exchange skills and knowledge. Users can create profiles highlighting their skills and areas they wish to learn more about. The application will enable user authentication, allowing for secure management of user data and interactions. Users can match with others who want to learn what they can teach, set up sessions, and provide feedback. The platform will emphasize a responsive design to enhance user experience across devices, ensuring accessibility and engagement. This project will not only serve practical purposes but also educate team members on full-stack development, including building APIs, implementing authentication protocols, and applying UI/UX design principles.
